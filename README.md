# SFML Android Template
Android Studio template for deploying SFML apps on Android.

I've made this easy to set up by including a precompiled version of SFML, ARM64 doesn't compile yet, but it has ARMV7 and x86 libraries, for easy testing with the Android Emulator.


## Instructions
1. Open the project in Android Studio, or run `./gradlew assembleDebug`
2. Simply build the project, and it should compile.
